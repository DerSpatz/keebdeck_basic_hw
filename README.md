# KeebDeck Basic

![](./img/basic.jpg)

An affordable handheld QWERTY USB keyboard with a silicone keypad.

This is our first product using our KeebDeck Keyboard, meant to be a cost-effective way to demonstrate the capabilities of the Keyboard. It exposes the key presses as a **USB HID** over **USB Type-C**. The board also includes an unpopulated **Qwiic connector** footprint on the back, and test points with an I2C interface compatible with our previous BBQ10/BBQ20 boards.
